# shortcut-manager
This is a simple shortcut manager

I'm sill learning so please don't judge the crappy code

## USAGE
To add a shortcut you can eddit the `paths.txt` file or do it through the manager.
When editing the `paths.txt` file make shure to separate the name and the url/path with "|".
After adding the first shortcut through the manager you have to go into the `paths.txt` file and remove the first empty line (I'll fix this later).
